In this assignment we looked at a data set that looked at students grades among differnt schools and determined the differences between them. We looked specific school types such as Charter schools and District schools. We also looked at the percentage rates of math, reading, and the overall rates of the schools. This data set would be very useful when trying to determine the best types, sizes, and budgets are needed to make the students successful.
